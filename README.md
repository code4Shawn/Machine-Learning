# Machine-Learning Class Task 1

You are expected to generate a fake Nairobi Office Price Simulated dataset of size 100 with One feature ùíô (office size assume a suitable distribution) and one target ùë¶ (office price also assume a suitable distribution).
Write class logic for Mean Squared Error to be used as your Performance Measure Technique and Gradient Descent as your learning algorithm
Set random initial values for slope (m) and y-intercept (c) and train an intelligent linear regression model of your dataset above then plot the line of best fit
Use the above learnt line to predict the office price when the size is 100 sq. ft.

# Machine-Learning Class Task 2

You are provided with the Housing Pricing dataset.

i. Prepare a dataset description file
ii. Prepare the dataset for training
iii. Fill in Missing Values
iv. Encode the dataset
v. Standardize the dataset
vi. Perfom feature extraction using PCA
vii. Perform feature selection using L1
viii. Train a regression model using PCA with 2 compnents
